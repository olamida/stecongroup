LOAD DATA INFILE "C:/xampp/htdocs/stecongroup-july-2020/country-code.txt" INTO TABLE countries(id, name, code) SET created_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

	

1.	In "C:\xampp\htdocs\olanda-laravel", change ".env.example" to '.env'

2.	Create Database on your .env file update the following lines:

		DB_CONNECTION=mysql
		DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
		DB_PORT=3306
		DB_DATABASE=olandasolutions
		DB_USERNAME=root
		DB_PASSWORD=

3.	Change directory to "C:\xampp\htdocs\olanda-laravel"

4.	Laravel project dependencies are managed through the PHP Composer tool. 
	The first step is to install the depencencies by typing this command:
		composer install

5.	Generate the key with the following command: 
		php artisan key:generate

6.	We are going to run the built in migrations to create the database tables:
		php artisan migrate

7.	Now seed the database with:	
		php artisan db:seed

username: admin@admin.com
pass: secret


php artisan storage:link

Troubleshooting
------------------------
If for any reason something goes wrong, try the following:

composer clear-all from the CLI

This will:

php artisan clear-compiled
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
composer dumpautoload -o


Roll Back & Migrate Using A Single Command
The migrate:refresh command will roll back all of your migrations and then execute the migrate command. This command effectively re-creates your entire database:

php artisan migrate:refresh

// Refresh the database and run all database seeds...
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed

Deployment
----------

php artisan config:cache
Because every time you make a change in the .env file, you have to clear the cache to make the changes work

When pushing your app to production, you should make sure you run the following:


yarn prod
Compress all of you assets into a single file specified in webpack.mix.js.


composer cc
This will run the above clear-all command followed by the cache-all command:

php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache

*	Drop All Tables & Migrate
	The migrate:fresh command will drop all tables from the database and then execute the migrate command:
		php artisan migrate:fresh
		php artisan migrate:refresh --seed


*	New Controller, Model, and Migration with single command
	You can do it if you start from the model
	php artisan make:model Todo -mcr
	if you run 
		php artisan make:model --help you can see all the available options
		-m, --migration Create a new migration file for the model.
		-c, --controller Create a new controller for the model.
		-r, --resource Indicates if the generated controller should be a resource controller


*	Error about missing migration file?
	It's not a cache issue. You just have to run composer again:
		composer dump-autoload

		

*	https://laravel-love.readme.io/docs/installation-instructions
	implement laravel-love for likes and dislikes
	Pull in the package through Composer.
		$ composer require cybercog/laravel-love
	Run database migrations.
		$ php artisan migrate







moving the default folder for files
--------------------------------------

By default Laravel will look in Http/Controllers folder to look for Controllers, in order to change this , we have to modify Providers/RouteServiceProviders.php and change 
protected $namespace = 'App\Http\Controllers'
to 
protected $namespace = ''
But remember, now every time when you include your controller you will have to insert full insert full namespace. For example, now in routes you will have a route to login like this:
Route::post('login', 'App\Http\Modules\Auth_Module\Controllers\AuthController@login');

In order to move models, to our new folder you can just create them there, but if you want to move User.php model to a new folder - in this case you have to inofrm Laravel and make this change inside of config/auth.php

And one more thing, now when you want to generate controller using artisan command, you have to use relative paths:
php artisan make:controller ../Modules/Auth_Module/Controllers/AuthController





Status Code	Meaning
404	Not Found (page or other resource doesn’t exist)
401	Not authorized (not logged in)
403	Logged in but access to requested area is forbidden
400	Bad request (something wrong with URL or parameters)
422	Unprocessable Entity (validation failed)
500	General server error
